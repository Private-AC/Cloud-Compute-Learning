Just Basics of MySQL Server

  Installation of SQL Server.
    > wget url from offical page
    > rpm -ivh package.rpm 
    > yum install -y mysql_server

  If the repo and package is available in the system we can just install 
    > yum install -y mysql_server

  start the services using 
    > systemctl start sqld
    > status check the same 

  Now check fo the log files to get the user login for the server.
    > cat /var/log/sql/mysqld.log

  To login to the SQL Server
    > mysql -u username -p password which will be located in the log file

  Some times it will require to change the password for the root user to do so 
    > ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

  Now we can start using the server

    Some basic commands to work with SQL Server.

        > SHOW DATABASES; (To view the list of databases available we can host multiple DB of a single SQL Server)
        > CREATE DATABASE dbname; (To create a new DB on the Server)
        > USE dbname; (To start working on the DB server)
        > CREATE TABLE tbname ( Name varchar(255), Age int, Location varchar(255) ); {This is a command that is used to create table with the details in to it}
        > SHOW TABLES; (To verify the tables on the DB)
        > INSERT INTO tbname values ("John", 45, "UK"); {This is the command to insert the value to table}
        > SELECT * FROM tbname; (To view the inserted vaules in the table)

    Creation of user in the DB.
      By default root has all the access and permission on all the DB's by default.

        Adding user to the DB.

           > CREATE USER 'ram'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' (For this the user can only login for the localhost)
                
           > CREATE USER 'ram'@'192.168.0.109' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' (Login to the server from internet with specific IP)
      
           > CREATE USER 'ram'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' (Login to the server from all the system)

      Privileges to the users.

          systax: GRANT <PERMISSION> ON <DATABASE.TABLE> TO 'ram'@'localhost';

      Privileges 

        All PRIVILEGES  ------  Grants full access
        CREATE      ----------  create DB
        DROP        ----------  delete DB
        DELETE      ----------  delete row from table
        INSERT      ----------  insert row into table
        SELECT      ----------  read/query table
        UPDATE      ----------  update rows in table

      Some Examples for access.

          > GRANT SELECT ON database.table TO 'ram'@'localhost';  (Single permission)

          > GRANT UPDATE, DELETE ON database.table TO 'ram'@'localhost'; (Multiple Permission)

          > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'ram'@'localhost'; (Full access similar to root)

      To list out the permission for a user.

        > SHOW GRANTS FOR 'ram'@'localhost';


      To revoke or remove the access to the 

          > REVOKE SELECT ON database.table FROM 'ram'@'localhost';  (Single permission)
