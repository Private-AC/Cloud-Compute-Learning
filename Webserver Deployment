Deployed a LAMP Stack website from a localhost with all the services built on the same server.

LAMP Stack (Linux Apache MongoDB Php)

I had done only the deployment part of the code and had got the code from Github  kodekloudhub/learning-app-ecommerce 

            > Delpoyed a webserver on the newly installed VM with multiple adapters enabled i.e. NAT and bridge adapters and was able to access the the webserver on the localhost of the VM as well as also able to access the webserver,
              on the host browser since the bridge adapter was enabled. (Note: that webserver was deployed with the help of kodekloudhub/learning-app-ecommerce code)
            > The deployment type was All in one setup like the webserver and database server in a single VM.
            > Webserver used was Apache and the code was in Php, Database used us MariaDB.

Requirements:
      > Apache, MariaDB, Php-sqlnd

Lets get into deployment:

      > Install firewall and enable it.
      > Install MariaDB and enable it.
      > Enable the firewall to open for the port on which mariadb is working i.e. 3306.
      > Configure the Database with user name, password, and permissions for the DB.
      > A small script needs to loaded into the database please follow the readme file from the project file.
      > Webpage configuration as we are going to deploy a php server we need to change the index.html to index.php in the configuration file of the http serivce.
      > Download the code from Git hub and place in the /var/www/html/.
      > create a .env file into the root folder of the code and insert the DB config files init.
      > A small code chage needs to made from  the main file of index.html to load the .env code.

Once done we can verify the procress bu curling or load the website in the local browser with http://localhost.

Problems faced during the delpoyment:
            > Was not able to find the depencenices file on .env and checked it there was a spelling error in it and rectified it.
            > While deploying the webserver i was not able to connect to the database and found that it was related to the dependencies and was rectified by installing.
