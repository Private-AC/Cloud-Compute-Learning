MongoDB is a document based database which stores data sets in the form json document.

Installation of MongoDB 
      > wget <mongodb url>
      > unpack the rpm package 
      > Or else extract the tar file 

Install the Mogodb Server
      > yum install -y mongodb-org
      > start the service mongod
      > Check the status of the service

Working on the mongo server
      > mongod
List the databases 
      > show dbs
use or switch the database to write into it 
      > use db_name
to insert adocument on to the database server we need to add a collection
      > db.createcollection new_collection
Now we can insert the data to the collection in Json format
      > db.new_collection.insert ({
            "name": "Rama"
            "age": 25
            "location": "Mysore"
            "salary": "50000"
            })
To reterive data from database
      > db.collection_name.find() "Each document in the database has a unique ID associated with it"

To filter a search from database and get specific output
      > db.collection_name.find({"name": "Rama"}) "Like wise we can add fileter in the find section and get the accurate data required"
