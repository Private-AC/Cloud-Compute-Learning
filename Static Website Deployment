Deployed a LAMP Stack website from a localhost with all the services built on the same server.

LAMP Stack (Linux Apache MongoDB Php)

I had done only the deployment part of the code and had got the code from Github  kodekloudhub/learning-app-ecommerce 

Requirements:
      > Apache, MariaDB, Php-sqlnd

Lets get into deployment:

      > Install firewall and enable it.
      > Install MariaDB and enable it.
      > Enable the firewall to open for the port on which mariadb is working i.e. 3306.
      > Configure the Database with user name, password, and permissions for the DB.
      > A small script needs to loaded into the database please follow the readme file from the project file.
      > Webpage configuration as we are going to deploy a php server we need to change the index.html to index.php in the configuration file of the http serivce.
      > Download the code from Git hub and place in the /var/www/html/.
      > create a .env file into the root folder of the code and insert the DB config files init.
      > A small code chage needs to made from  the main file of index.html to load the .env code.

Once done we can verify the procress bu curling or load the website in the local browser with http://localhost.
