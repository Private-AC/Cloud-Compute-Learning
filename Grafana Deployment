Overview
Grafana is a tool used to create dashboards and visualize data. It can pull information from many different sources, no matter where they’re hosted. You can build your own dashboards from scratch or use ready-made templates if you want something quick.
To actually show data in Grafana, you need something to collect that data. That’s where Prometheus comes in. Prometheus gathers metrics from different systems, but it usually needs exporters to get those metrics.

Common Exporters.
Node Exporter.
This one collects system-level information from a machine — things like 
CPU Usage, Memory, Disk space, and other hardware or resource metrics.

Blackbox Exporter.

The Blackbox Exporter checks if a service or website is reachable. It can monitor things like 
Uptime, Response status, and SSL certificate expiry.

Deployment of Grafana & Prometheus.
Grafana OSS (Open Source Software)

Grafana Cloud (Managed by Grafana)
Deployment of Grafana OSS
How to deploy Grafana OSS on the Local machine I considered 2 Virtual Machines from AWS.

With Following Spec Config 
Application Server (We are going with a Apache Web Server, Node Exporter)

Linux Server (Amazon Linux OS)
t2 micro Instance Type
Keep rest to default 
Security Group (Some Custom Ports like 3000-9000, 443, 80)
Storage 8GB
Launch Instance 

Monitoring Server (To deploy Prometheus, Grafana & Blackbox Exporter)
Linux Server (Amazon Linux OS)
t2 small Instance Type
Keep rest to default 
Same security Group
Storage 20GB 
Launch Instance 

Application Server
We need to login to the server through Putty or mobaxterm
Install the following in order to start the Webserver and Node Exporter

Installing Apache Web Server

sudo yum install -y httpd
After installation start the service 
sudo systemctl start httpd

You can test the connectivity of the webserver by 
Open browser and enter the ip,adddress:80 if you will see startup page of Apache Server


Installing Node Exporter 

wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.10.2/node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvf node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz (Extract the tar file)
cd node_exporter-1.10.2.linux-amd64 
./node_exporter & (This command will help it to run of node_exporter in background)
To verify that the node_exporter is running open browser and run ip.address:9100

You can see the node exporter webpage.

Monitoring Server 
After logging into the server 
Install Prometheus, Blackbox & Grafana


Installing Prometheus 
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.8.0-rc.1/prometheus-3.8.0-rc.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvf prometheus-3.8.0-rc.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-3.8.0-rc.1.linux-amd64
ls (to list all the files)
vi prometheus.yml (This is the config file where we can make changes)
this is how a config file looks like 

This config file line tells us that it is monitoring the server where Prometheus is hosted.

Now we need to add the same line of code to monitor our application server.

Make sure the indentation is right as this is an ymal file to avoid errors

- job_name: "Application Server"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["Application server IP:9090"]
save the config file and run Prometheus.

./prometheus (procress will run in the forground)
./prometheus & (to run in Background)
To test the if is running Prometheus on browser run monitoring server ip.address:9090 you can see similar page like this 

Installing Blackbox

sudo wget https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases/download/v0.27.0/blackbox_exporter-0.27.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar xvf blackbox_exporter-0.27.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd blackbox_exporter-0.27.0.linux-amd64
./blackbox_exporter &
Now go back to the Prometheus Config File and add following lines at the end.

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx] # This must match a module in your blackbox.yml
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - http://example.com # Target to be probed for testing you can add any website
        - https://google.com # Target to be probed for testing you can add any website
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115  # The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port. Your Monitoring Server IP:9115
This is how the final config file looks like

Test the same on the browser to verify Monitoring Server ip.address:9115.

Installing Grafana 

sudo yum install -y https://dl.grafana.com/grafana-enterprise/release/12.3.0/grafana-enterprise_12.3.0_19497075765_linux_amd64.rpm
After installation start the server demon and the service itself

sudo /bin/systemctl demon grafana
sudo systemctl start granafa
To verify open the browser and run monitoring server ip.address:3000

You will see Grafana Login Page 

default user details 
User ID - admin
Password - admin

Click on Add your first data source.

Search for Prometheus and add the server url.

Then scroll to the bottom and click on save and test.

From the above image click on dashboard 

Click on New  >  Import 

Search for few pre-built dashboard from browser for Node_Exporter add copy the ID 

Paste the Copied ID and Load (ID is 1860)

You can find the similar Dashboard View for Node Exporter


Similarly load in the same fashion for Blackbox

You can find the same view as below
