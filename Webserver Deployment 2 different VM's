Webserver Deployment on two different VM's 

It is similar to the Pervious Webserver Deployment but other there i had deployed all the services on a single which are Php webserver and MariaDB.

The webpage was working as to be expected.

But when i tried the same experiment on two different VM's as in One Webserver and other Database Server.

I had ran the same configuration file within the servers and was thrown out with an error as Database error 2002:permission Denined.

      > Had checked with the log files on both Database server and webserver.
      > Checked with the connectivity of the database and its user which we had created to communicate with the server.
      > Had tried buy disableing the firewall it dint workout.
      > Making the changes with the Database permission for which i had given full access to the user.
      > Checked with SElinux Permission and tried to disable and failed with same error.
      > Also tried with the file permission to the httpd file and actual code file.
      > Tried to disable the root password for the database.
      > Lastly searched with the error on stack overflow and got the resolution with the exact result "Connect database error type 2002 permission denied"
      > Got the exact fix with the issue and worked with SElinux security policies.
                > getsebool -a | grep httpd
                > Check for the httpd Network 
                > setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1

After done with the final steps I had figured with the issue and fixed it.
