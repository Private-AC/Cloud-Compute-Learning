We are going to install an Apache Web Server on a Linux Virtual Machine
For this set up i am going to use Virtual Box for deploying VM.
We are going to deploy CentOS 9 on our Virtual Box with Network set to Bridge Adapter default settings.

After deploying CentOS on the VM.

> Install httpd or appache server 
    command - sudo yum install httpd
> Start httpd 
    Command - sudo systemctl start httpd.service 
> Check Status
    Command - systemctl status httpd

Check for the server if running on the local browser within VM.

> Check for IP details from VM
    Command - ip a
> Check for server reachabality by using the IP in local browser.
    For now you can see the test page up and running 

Now we should try to check for the server rechabality outside VM within Computer's local browser.

> We must change the firewall settings in VM 
    Command - firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanant
> Now you can see the test page working on your local browser
