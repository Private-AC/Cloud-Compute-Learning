Hosting multiple website in a single Apache Web Server

we have two different ways:

1st method:

> Initial steps for the installation of the server is similar as installation of Apache Server

Now we need to configure the apache server file which is located in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

        > Find ServerName in the configuration file and in the next line servername and fully qualified domain name and port no 
                ServerName www.houses.com:80
        > After that line add the below line of code to run multiple website
            > 1st website    
                <VirtualHost *:80>
                 ServerName www.houses.com
                 DocumentRoot /var/www/houses
                </VirtualHost>
            > 2nd website    
                <VirtualHost *:80>
                 ServerName www.oranges.com
                 DocumentRoot /var/www/oranges
                </VirtualHost>
        > Now we need to add the configuration files of both websites in a directory under /var/www/
              > 1st website   
                    > /var/www/houses/index.html  (I have added only html file for testing)
              > 2nd website   
                    > /var/www/oranges/index.html  (I have added only html file for testing)
        > Once all this is done we need to make changes in the hosts file under /etc/hosts
              > Add a new entry for the two websites  
                    > 192.168.0.109    www.houses.com
                    > 192.168.0.109    www.oranges.com
        > After all the initilization restart the apache server 
              > Command " systemctl restart httpd " or " service httpd restart "


2nd method:

Changes needs to made in the configuration files as mentioned below 

    > get into /etc/httpd/conf/ directory 
          > create a file called houses.conf and insert the below lines
                <VirtualHost *:80>
                 ServerName www.houses.com
                 DocumentRoot /var/www/houses
                </VirtualHost>
          > > create another file called oranges.conf and insert the below lines
                <VirtualHost *:80>
                 ServerName www.oranges.com
                 DocumentRoot /var/www/ornages
                </VirtualHost>
    > After making the above changes get into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
          > Add these lines in the end of the configuration file
              Include conf/houses.conf
              Include conf/oranges.conf
    > After all the initilization restart the apache server 
              > Command " systemctl restart httpd " or " service httpd restart "
